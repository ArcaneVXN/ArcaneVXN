## ðŸ”® ArcaneVXN â€” Rebuilding Reality from Code

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- ArcaneEngine: a fully customized C++ game and simulation engine.
- ArcaneRoom: an integrated developer suite for code, art, sound, and AI tools.
- Temple Systems: pressure-based hardware and intelligent shielding tech.

- A Tkinter-based graphical user interface for generating 3D assets using the DreamGaussian pipeline.
Easily create OBJ meshes and textures from text or image prompts. Includes optional voxel export (experimental).


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- Compiler architecture, graphics pipelines, and reverse-engineering Unreal/Godot internals.
- Full system stack integration from physics engines to AI scripting layers.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
- Visionary indie tools, game engines, and world-building systems.
- Any project that needs raw low-level code, creative fire, and spiritual intelligence.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:
- Funding and exposure for the ArcaneVXN ecosystem.
- Scaling cross-platform builds and GPU performance tuning.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
- C++ engine internals, ImGui/GLFW/Clang/Ninja/CMake pipeline setups.
- Engine refactoring, custom build systems, real-time simulation architecture.

âš¡ Fun fact:
Everything Iâ€™m building is from scratch â€” no teams, no studios, no shortcuts.
